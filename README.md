# sphinx_test

`Sphinx` is a tool that can be used to auto-generate code documentation in several formats including HTML.  I followed this [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/index.html) to get familiar with the features, pushed the files to my GitHub repository and published the auto-generated HTML files to a [static site](https://george-brand.github.io/sphinx_test/) using `GitHub Pages`.
